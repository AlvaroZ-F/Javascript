/*
	onMouse and onLoad Events. We've got to be able to draw in two different colors
	with our mouse. Firstly we must build a canvas, which would actually be a table
	with multiple small (100x100) cells. You program shall create this canvas once 
	it loads the page (onLoad). After that, it must detect the mouse movement so once 
	it passes by then, it'd color them in red if they are also holding the ctrl
	key, or blue if they are holding the shift key. In any other case, it won't print 
	anything.
