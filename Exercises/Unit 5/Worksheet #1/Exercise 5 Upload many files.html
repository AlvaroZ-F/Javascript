<!--
	Create a web application to upload files to the server. Using DOM, 
	make it so the user can submit as many files as they wish to. Therefore,
	initially it'd be necessary to implement an input type file, a button 
	"Submit another file", and a second button called "Submit", so once 
	the first button is clicked on, it'd automatically create another input
	to select a file.
