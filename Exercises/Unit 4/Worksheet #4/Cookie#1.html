		Design a website that'd use cookies to store the username. In case we'd have no cookies from this site, it'd have to ask the username and store in a cookie that'd expire in 5 minutes. After this, it'd say hello to the user through a message on screen. In case we'd already have the cookie created it'd be able to read it, and print the previously mentioned messaged automatically. It'd also provide a link to delete the cookie (We can call it "Logout").
		Be sure your cookie can store any sort of character.
