		<!-- Elaborate a simple register form for your website. It must have at least fields for each of this data: Name, Surname, DNI, Phone number, email and username. All fields are required, and you have to validate as many as you can using regular expressions. The username must have 8 characters at least, must include any number and a special character (commas, dots, etc).
			The validation has also to be live, in other words, as soon the user leaves the field for the next one, it has to validate it even if it hasn't been submitted, informing the user if it's correct or not.
