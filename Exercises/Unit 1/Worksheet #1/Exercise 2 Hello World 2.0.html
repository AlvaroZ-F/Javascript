	Modify exercise 1 so it'd perform these behaviours:
	 -All the javascript program is stored in an external file called "Script.js" and it keeps working exactly the same.
	 -After the first message, it must show another one saying "I'm the first script".
	 -Add some comments explaining how does the script work.
	 -Add in the html webpage a warning for the browsers which don't have javascript support activated.
