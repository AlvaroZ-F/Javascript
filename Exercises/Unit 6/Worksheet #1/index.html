<!--
	Develop a website that'd work as an email client. In order to do that
	let's assume that in your server we'd have an script that as soon an
	email would be received, it'd be written into a XML file. Thus:
		-> Define the file XML format that it'd allow us to simulate this
		situation.
		-> Create the website with the needed interface so it'd update
		the mail list periodically on its own.
